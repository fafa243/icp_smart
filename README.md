# Smart contract weather
This weather website provides extensive and in-depth weather information, not only monitoring weather conditions in the local area, but also covering a wider area up to the national level. By integrating sensor data, users can access the latest weather updates not only relevant to the micro-conditions around them, but also provide a holistic insight into atmospheric conditions across the nation. 

## Key feature
1. **Temperature:**
   Measuring overall air and water temperature provides a holistic, multi-faceted perspective, enabling a deeper understanding of temperature trends in a broader scope.
2. **Rainfall:**
   Detecting potential upcoming rainfall in the vicinity is a proactive effort in obtaining weather information to mitigate its impact.
3. **Rain time:**
   Using up-to-date weather data, the system is able to detect when rainfall will begin and provide an estimated time until it ends.
